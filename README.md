##  Project Objective
This project demonstrates a relational database system to manage core hospital operations—such as tracking doctors, patients, departments, scheduling, and billing—using SQL. The goal is to simulate practical hospital workflow scenarios in a structured manner.

---

##  Features & Scope
- **Tables included**: Patients, Doctors, Departments, Appointments, Billing, etc.
- **SQL Elements**: Schema creation, relationships via primary/foreign keys, constraints, and sample records.
- **Queries**: Extracting patient history, doctor schedules, billing summaries, and department-wise data retrieval.
- **Refinements**:
  - Updated naming convention for clarity (e.g., `PhysicianID` instead of `DoctorID`).
  - Foldered SQL scripts for ease of access (e.g., `schema.sql`, `data.sql`, `queries.sql`).

---

##  How to Explore
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `schema.sql` in your SQL environment to create tables.
3. Run `data.sql` to load sample data.
4. Execute `queries.sql` to view pre-written queries.
5. Modify or extend as needed for deeper insight.

---

##  Insights
- Demonstrates ability to model real-world data structures.
- Reinforces SQL fundamentals: joins, constraints, and query formulation.
- Useful for academic, professional, and consulting applications.

---

##  Tools & Platforms
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / Oracle)
- GitHub (for version control and showcasing)

_Originally developed from an open-source template, this version includes customized organization, naming conventions, and personal documentation to aid readability and usability._
